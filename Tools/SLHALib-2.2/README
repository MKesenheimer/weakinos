To build the SLHA2 I/O library, enter

./configure
make
make install

The files are installed in

<prefix>/lib      -- the SLHA library,
<prefix>/bin      -- helper scripts,
<prefix>/include  -- include files for the SLHA library,

where <prefix> is by default the same as the HOSTTYPE
environment variable (e.g. i586-linux).  To override this,
add --prefix=<prefix> to the configure command line.
See ./configure --help for a complete list of options.


The library libSLHA.a provides the following routines:

SLHAClear	-- clear a SLHA record,
SLHARead	-- read a file into an SLHA record,
SLHAWrite	-- write an SLHA record to file,
SLHAPutInfo	-- write to the text fields of the record,
SLHAGetInfo	-- read from the text fields of the record,
SLHANewDecay	-- initiate setting of decay information,
SLHAFindDecay	-- initiate appending to decay information,
SLHAAddDecay	-- add information for a decay channel,
SLHAGetDecay	-- read decay information for a selected channel,
SLHADecayTable	-- read all decay information for a selected decay,
SLHAExist	-- check whether a block is not entirely empty,
SLHAValid	-- check whether a block consists entirely of valid data,
SLHAPDGName	-- translate a PDG code to a particle name.

Please see the manual in SLHALib2.pdf for a detailed description.


A few demonstration programs are included in the "demo"
subdirectory.  They are built by typing "make demo" which
creates the executables build/copy, build/table, and 
build/timing (these are not installed by "make install").

The demos can be tested on the SLHA example files in the
"examples" directory.


Bug reports, suggestions for improvement, and fan mail
should be addressed to Thomas Hahn <hahn@feynarts.de>.


Enjoy!
