To set up a new process:
------------------------
1) Run "make" to compile MadGraph (and pythia-pgs and analysis packages, 
if downloaded and untarred)

2) Copy the Template directory to some other name, e.g. MyProcDir, in
order to always keep a clean copy of the Template.

3) Edit the file proc_card.dat in the MyProcDir/Cards directory to set
up one or more processes to be run simultaneously. Don't forget to
specify choice of model.

4) Go to the MyProcDir directory and run bin/newprocess to set up the
specified process. Please notice that this will replace the file
Cards/param_card.dat by the default param_card.dat for the model.

5) Check that the generation worked, using your web browser, by
looking at index.html in the MyProcDir directory.

To generate events with the process already set up:
---------------------------------------------------
Please see the README file in the MyProcDir directory.

To set up a new process using MadGraph "stand alone" (i.e. without MadEvent)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the above instructions but execute ./bin/standalone before ./bin/newprocess

To use the DECAY package (DECAY directory)
------------------------------------------
To compile it: make
To use it:
./decay and follow the instructions
