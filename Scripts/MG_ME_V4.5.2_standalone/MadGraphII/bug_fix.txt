Date		Bug			Fix

11/16/00	Not rejecting wrong	vert4.f subroutine check4v 
		order in coupling	implicit none
					character*(10)  coup_name(max_coup)
					integer		ncoups
					common/to_couplings/ncoups,coup_name
					
12/12/00	ww->hh extra stuff	nvert3   AddSSS1  needed to inverse
							particle for HVS
					line 487 ipart2(3) = 1
					line 488 ipart2(4) = inverse(ipart(3))

1/15/01		g77 compiler troubles	remove ichar from parameter statements
					change isubfile in params.inc from 
					312 to 28

1/31/01		Color Flow Comments	Added color flow comments to output
					see  write_color_comment() in colors.f

2/07/01		Majorona Fix		Particles.f made CC call for antipart
					have the -1 needed. Still 2.4

Version 2.42

2/12/01		User specified		Modified readprocess and fields.f
		intermediate particles

		ps output for g77	drawfeyn.f '0 Fphoton' -> '  0 Fphoton

2/13/01		More PS improvemets	Allows for xscale/yscale
					avoids crossing lines
		Increased known colors  Added T[i,j,a,b]+T[i,j,b,a]
		Removed Majorona loop	if no majorona particles


Version 2.45
2/20/01		Color Factors for MSSM

Version 2.46

2/22/01		Require s_channel particles
		Avoid crossed lines

		Need to handle 3 external particles!!!!!

4/23/01		Fixed color for CC process when color is T[i,j] not T[a,i,j]

Version 2.49


6/11/01		Drawfeyn.f gives div/0 for zero length line. 

9/3/01          writeamp.f used used nexternal+1 instead of nexternal

Versopm 2.xx

11/15/01	Outputs configs.inc 
                Fixed nvert4_new.f to avoid double comma in some routines

Version 2.70
03/10/02	Outputs in Les Houche Format

Version 2.99    readproc.f and driver.f added cross_opt
11/29/02        Disables crossing optimization when requiring s-channel particles

5/21/03		tops.f, fixed initialization problem for 1->2 or 2->1
		processes which put code in infinite loop

5/27/03		tops.f fixed infinite loop in next_top() when had
		only 3 external particles. Also initilized tid() in 
		fields.f

Version 3.00    Changed sumgluons to .false. to prevent fake color connections
02/19/04        Added version information to output files

03/10/04        Added delta_AB color configuration for ggh interaction

Version 3.05
1/29/04		Fixed problem with majorana VSS vertex. Now works for MSSM
		Added ability to read multiple compound particles P,J,L etc

Version 3.90    Fixed problem with SSS vertex, typeO for ipart(2)=1 case.
8/26/05
Version 3.91    Fixed problem with VVSS vertex, typeO for setting masses ipart(2).

3/19/2006	Allow for process prefix character defined in readproc.f
		also modify sort.f so different prefix not cross optimized

3/20/2006	Changed order of color for 3 and 3bar in T_ij and delta_ij
		Not causing any problems, though it was problem for VVS

3/21/2006	Fix color factor switching for VVS and VVVS routines when
		all are color octets. Requires swapping f^abc -> f^acb for
		the JVS routine. Other routines were OK

4/17/06         The file fermi4.f had the possibility of making a sign error for crossed
                fermion lines. It took a special set of circumstances involving majorana
                fermions to make this happen, so it got through most of our tests.
