This directory contains samples for all the cards which are used by
MadGraph/MadEvent during the various stages of code operation.

  Card: proc_card.dat        
  Use : This is the process generation card which is used by
        MadGraph to generate the code corresponding the user 
        request. It can be used by all user's levels.
        It now supports multi-processes to be requested at the same
        time. In this case the events produced are in the right relative
        ratio also for the different procs. Inclusive samples, like W+jets,
        are produced starting from this option.
