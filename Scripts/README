In order to run the Mathematica script properly you have to replace the 
provided files in "./Modified Files" with the ones in your FeynArts and 
FormCalc directory, respectively.
If you are not sure what you do, create backups of your original files.

Changing the files was necessary since FeynArts was doing something weird
while creating the Fortran code. With the provided files it is easier to 
create Fortran code for MSSM processes and to get a better inside what 
FeynArts is doing (FeynArts creates now Adobe PDFs even for RenConst
diagrams). Additionally one can now calculate the RenConst without writing
them directly into a Fortran file. So it is possible to have some functions
operating on the RenConst and after this writing them into a Fortran file.
